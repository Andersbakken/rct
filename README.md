rct

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/Andersbakken/rct.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Andersbakken/rct)

A set of c++ tools that provide nicer (more Qt-like) APIs on top of stl classes
released under a BSD license.

## Branch 'win'

On this branch, I [Gei0r](https://github.com/Gei0r) try to port rct to native
Windows using mingw64 from msys2.
Priority is on the classes needed for rtags.
